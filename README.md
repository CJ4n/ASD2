# ASD2
My projects form university courser Algorithms and Data Structures 2 

DISCLAIMER!!!
I did not prepare any of the tests for any of those projects!!!
We are provided with tests by our teachers!!!

TestSet.dll is required to run any of the projects and Graph.ddl for most of them.
Just add is as a reference to the project.

To use Graph.chm you'll probably need to unblock it:
